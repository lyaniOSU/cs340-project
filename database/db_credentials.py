# To actually have your app use this file, you need to RENAME the file to db_credentials.py
# You will find details about your CS340 database credentials on Canvas.

# the following will be used by the webapp.py to interact with the database
# You can also use environment variables

# For Local Development
host = 'localhost'
user = 'root'                  # can be different if you set up another username in your MySQL installation
passwd = 'password'                        # set accordingly
db = 'db'
